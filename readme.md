# cyberWatch

Simple OS for [LILYGO® T-WATCH-2020 V3](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-watch-2020-v3), based on [ Xinyuan-LilyGO /TTGO_TWatch_Library](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library). Partially support for LILYGO® T-WATCH-2020 V2

Free time project to create lightweight and simple OS for smartwatch, with only necessary small functionality (to keep it simple and effective). With strong DIY cyberpunk motivation (don't want to support and pay money to big corporations). And with cool 80' cyberpunk retro design!

## Known bugs
 - "tilt up" maneuver sometimes doesn't activate display (maybe will be solved by tuning BMA423 sensor)
 - activated by touch (when display is off) also do "touch event" on component on touch coords (e.g. when current screen is watch settings, activation also can activated display on, when display activation touch is at left top corner of display )
